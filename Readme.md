# Crop Image Classification System

## Overview

This project implements a crop image classification system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow and Keras. The model is trained to identify different types of crops from images. The dataset used for this project contains images of [mention the specific crops if you remember, e.g., sugarcane, wheat, jute, maize, and rice].

The goal of this project is to develop a system that can accurately classify crop images, which can be useful for various applications in agriculture, such as automated crop identification, disease detection (if the dataset includes such data), and precision farming.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of images of different crop types. The `crop_details.csv` file provides the paths to these images and their corresponding labels. The dataset is organized into directories based on the crop type.

[Optionally, add more details about the dataset if you know them, e.g., source, size, any preprocessing steps done on the original data.]

## Project Structure
.
├── crop_classification_model.h5  # Trained Keras model
├── archive.zip             # Containing all the files(i.e. .csv, images[in kog2 and crop_images], test_crop_images, some_more_images)
├── cropidentifier.ipynb           # Kaggle notebook containing the code
└── README.md                     # This file

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository :**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd crop-image-classification
    ```

2.  **Download the dataset:** The dataset used in this project is likely available on Kaggle(link: "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aman2000jaiswal/agriculture-crop-images?resource=download") and it is in archive.zip . You might need to download it separately and place it in the appropriate directory structure if you're running the notebook outside of Kaggle. If you're using the Kaggle environment, the paths in `crop_details.csv` should work directly.

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install tensorflow keras pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn Pillow tqdm
    ```
    (It's recommended to use a virtual environment for this.)

4.  **Run the notebook:** Open and run the `cropidentifier.ipynb` file using kaggle notebook. The notebook contains the code for loading the data, preprocessing the images, building and training the CNN model, and evaluating its performance.

## Model Architecture

The CNN model used in this project consists of the following layers:

* Convolutional layers (`Conv2D`) with ReLU activation.
* Max pooling layers (`MaxPooling2D`) for downsampling.
* A flattening layer (`Flatten`) to convert the 2D feature maps to a 1D vector.
* Dense (fully connected) layers with ReLU activation.
* A final dense output layer with `softmax` activation for multi-class classification.

The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and sparse categorical cross-entropy loss.

## Results

The trained model achieved a validation accuracy of approximately **95.5%** on the held-out validation set. The classification report and confusion matrix provide a more detailed breakdown of the model's performance on each crop type.

[You can optionally include a snippet of the classification report or a visual of the confusion matrix here if you want to highlight the results directly in the README.]

## Usage

The trained model (`crop_classification_model.h5`) can be loaded and used to predict the crop type of new images. You would need to preprocess the new images (resize and normalize) in the same way as the training data before feeding them to the model for prediction.

```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import load_img, img_to_array
import numpy as np

# Load the trained model
model = load_model('crop_classification_model.h5')

# Load and preprocess a new image
img_path = 'path/to/your/new_image.jpg'
img_width, img_height = 128, 128
img = load_img(img_path, target_size=(img_width, img_height))
img_array = img_to_array(img)
img_array = np.expand_dims(img_array, axis=0) / 255.0

# Make a prediction
prediction = model.predict(img_array)
predicted_class_index = np.argmax(prediction)
class_labels = ['sugarcane', 'wheat', 'jute', 'maize', 'rice']
predicted_class_name = class_labels[predicted_class_index]

print(f"Predicted crop: {predicted_class_name}")


Potential Improvements
Data Augmentation: Implement data augmentation techniques to improve the model's generalization and robustness.
Transfer Learning: Explore using pre-trained models (e.g., MobileNetV2, VGG16) and fine-tuning them on this dataset.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Experiment with different model architectures, learning rates, batch sizes, and number of epochs.
Larger Dataset: Training on a larger and more diverse dataset could further improve performance.
Class Imbalance Handling: If the dataset has significant class imbalance, explore techniques to address it (e.g., oversampling, undersampling, weighted loss functions).
